### Progress
* Approach 1 -> Tried to build up on the library sqlparse, which I later found is getting complicated.
* Appraoch 2 -> Tried the brute force way to recognize each SQL query using patterns and regex.
* Approach 3 (Final Approach) -> Used some utilities of the sqlparse library and build up on that using normal brute force way.

### Final Output
Developed a SQL parser which parses the SQL command and stores it in the dictionary format.
Have used sqlparse library and string operations to build this.
